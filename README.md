# FRC VR

This is the library for use AR/VR. It uses websockets and an app called Sensor Server to connect to the driver station laptop. Then it uses network tables to put that data on the robot to interact with the camera. Written in python because it *looked* easy.

## Building FRC VR
This is a python project, so to build it you will need python installed and the pip dependencies below.

**pip dependencies**
websocket-client
pyntcore

you will likely need to change the URL to match how you're connecting your phone to Sensor Server. Although for competition you will have to use ADB.

## Connecing to Sensor Server

Obviously you will need to install it either from from F-Droid or from the github. You can connect to sensor server in 3 different ways, but only 2 are easy to implement.

**1. Using mobile hotspot**
Given that your phone can do hotspot this is the most simple way to do it, but you can't actuall use this in competition.
* 1. Turn on the hotspot option in Sensor Server
* 2. Check the IP it gives in the main screen in the app
* 3. replace the IP in headset.py to the one in the app
* 4. Run the project, it should connect and start outputting data

**2. Using ADB via USB**
This is what you will be using for competition if at all. It is completely wired

To connect over USB make sure USB debugging option is enable in your phone and ADB (android debug bridge) is available in your machine
connect phone to laptop via USB
Step 1 : Enable Local Host option in app
Step 2 : Run  "adb forward tcp:8081 tcp:8081" from driverstation laptop
Step 3 : use 'localhost' instead of the IP in headset.py
Make sure you have installed your android device driver and adb devices command detects your connected android phone.
